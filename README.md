# The-Chanel-Project
This repository is for members of VGDC that are participating in our game development project for Winter 2024!
1. Please check the VGDC for any updates and attach any neccessary roles that apply to you
2. Download Github desktop and please clone this repository onto the application.
3. When uploading your work, do NOT make changes directly into main. Everyone should have their own separate branch to work in and upload from. Admins will then review your work before approval.
4. Most importantly! Let's have fun and make a game together :D
